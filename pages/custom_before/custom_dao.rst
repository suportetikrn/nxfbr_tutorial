GUI - Using Dao and Data classes
*********************************

On typical web programming, dealing with DB is almost everything. We are using 'Data Access Object' and 'Data Object' for manipulating DB.
Common methods for a data access object
We have some common methods for most data access object classes. For example, on 'policy,policy.jsp' file we use PolicyDao and PolicyData class for manipulating policies. PolicyDao has these methods.
public int select_count() : The number of policies.
public List select_list() : Fetching policies as a list.
public PolicyData select_one(int id) : Fetching one policy by ID column.
public boolean insert(PolicyData data) : Insert a new policy.
public boolean update(PolicyData data) : Update a existing policy.
public boolean delete(int id) : Delete a policy by ID column.
Every policy data has its own unique ID which is a number and we use this ID for finding, updating a policy data.
Insert, delete, update, select data
If we want to modify 'whitelist,domain.jsp' we have to use 'WhitelistDomainDao' and 'WhitelistData' classes.
To insert a new data,

.. code-block:: jsp

 <%
   WhitelistDomainDao dao = new WhitelistDomainDao();
   WhitelistData data = new WhitelistData();
   data.domain = "*.nxfilter.org";
   data.bypass_auth = true;
   data.bypass_filter = true;
   dao.insert(data);
  %>

To delete a data when its ID is 12,
Para remover um registro cujo ID Ã© igual a 12,

.. code-block:: jsp

   <%
    WhitelistDomainDao dao = new WhitelistDomainDao();
    dao.delete(12);
   %>

Para selecionar um registro com ID igual a 12,

.. code-block:: jsp

   <%
    WhitelistDomainDao dao = new WhitelistDomainDao();
    WhitelistData data = dao.select_one(12);
   %>

E para atualizar o registro selecionado,

.. code-block:: jsp

   <%
     data.bypass_filter = false;
     dao.update(data);
   %>

E listar os registros.

.. code-block:: jsp

   <%
    WhitelistDomainDao dao = new WhitelistDomainDao();
    List data_list = dao.select_list();
    for(WhitelistData data : data_list){
       out.println(data.domain + "<br>");
    }
   %>

Accessing data field
Many Java developers are using 'get' and 'set' accessors for encapsulation and for having some additional data processing like validation. But for simplicity, we use a public field directly in most cases. For example, you get an instance of UserData and uses its 'name' property like the following codes,
<%
UserData data = new UserDao().select_one(1);
out.println(data.name)
%>
However there are some data classes having methods starting with 'get_'. These methods are mostly about formatting. We have 'ctime' property for 'RequestData' which we use on 'Logging > Request'. If you use it directly you get '201507081415' but when you use its 'get_ctime()' method you get '07/08 14:14'.
